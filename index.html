   <p style="text-align: left">
       WellBeing International (WBI) believes that providing access to appropriate resources helps to inform people about the choices they can make that will have a positive impact on not just themselves and their families, but also for animals and the environment.<b style="color: red "> ADD Your ID.</b> WBI's Global Awareness strategy consists of three major components: the WellBeing International Studies Repository, WBI's Website and our Direct Outreach via our newsletters (WellBeing News and Tales of WellBeing) and our social media pages. The newsletters translate current scientific knowledge into crisp, clear and readable articles that cover a broad range of issues addressing the interactions among people, animals and the environment <mark>(the PAE triad)</mark>.
       
       </p>
   <h4>WellBeing International Studies Repository</h4>
   <p>
       Public demand for information has grown dramatically in the past twenty years. This demand has been fueled by new technologies that enable individuals across the globe to access a huge amount of information very easily and quickly from their computers and smart phones. Literally, the globe's databases are in the palm of one's hand.

   </p>
    <p>
       WBI aims to become an important "go to" resource repository for academics, researchers, educators, and all those who want to know more about the well-being of people, animals, and the environment. The new repository is hosted by Digital Commons, a commercial institutional repository platform used "by over 500 academic institutions, healthcare centers, public libraries and research centers to showcase scholarly output and special collections." The WellBeing International Studies Repository is an open access collection of academic, archival, and assorted other materials related to the well-being of people, animals, and the environment (the PAE Triad).<i style="color: hotpink">LEARN MORE</i>
